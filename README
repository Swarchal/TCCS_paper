To run analysis use the main.R function, either within R or from the command
line with Rscript main.R  which first checks and installs the necessary
packages from CRAN and GitHub, and then runs the .R files in analysis/
to generate the plots used in the paper, which are saved as .eps files in
figures/.

NB. The CellProfiler pipelines will not run, due to the lack of hosted images.
