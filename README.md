To run analysis use the `main.R` function, either within R or from the command line with `Rscript main.R`  which first checks and installs the necessary packages from CRAN and GitHub, and then runs the .R files in `analysis/` to generate the plots used in the paper, which are saved as .eps files in `figures/`.

NB. The CellProfiler pipelines will not run, due to the lack of hosted images.
