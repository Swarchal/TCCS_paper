The R scripts assume the use of the .rproj file to correctly set the working directory.

To use without the .rproj file, the working directory has to be set to for the file paths to work correctly.

To run analysis use the `main.R` function, either within R or from the command line with `Rscript main.R`  which first checks and installs the necessary packages from CRAN and GitHub, and then runs the .R files in `analysis/` to generate the plots used in the paper, which are saved as .eps files in `figures/`.

NB. The CellProfiler pipelines will not run, due to the lack of hosted images.
